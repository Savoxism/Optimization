The Class - Course - Teacher Assignment and Timetabling
There are T teachers (1, 2, ... T) who need to be assigned to teach subjects to classes
There are M subjects 
There are N classes (1, 2, ... N). Each class has a list of subjects from (1, 2, ... M). Each class-subject pair is called a "class-subject"
Each subject m has a number of periods, denoted as d(m)
Each teacher t has a list of subjects they can teach 
There are 5 days in a week, 2 sessions per day, 6 periods each session

Create a schedule that strictly follows this constraint
+ Class-subjects from the same class cannot have overlapping timetables -> Each class can only attend one subject at a time 

+ Class-subjects assigned to the same teacher cannot have overlapping timetables -> If Teacher A is teaching Math to Class 1, they cannot simultaneously teach English to Class 2.

+ The total number of scheduled class-subjects and teacher assignments is maximized.

Inputs:
Line 1: T (number of teachers), N (number of classes), M (number of subjects) (1 ≤ N ≤ 100, 1 ≤ M ≤ 100, 1 ≤ T ≤ 100)
Line i + 1 (i = 1, ..., N): Contains the list of subjects that class i needs to study, ending with 0.
Line t + N + 1 (t = 1, 2, ..., T): Contains the list of subjects that teacher t can teach, ending with 0.
Line N + T + 2: Contains d(m), the number of hours required for subject m (m = 1, ..., M).

Output: 
Line 1: Write a positive integer K (the number of assignments).
Line k + 1 (k = 1, ..., K): Write 4 integers x, y, u, v, where:
x: The class number.
y: The subject number.
u: The starting period.
v: The teacher assigned to the subject.
