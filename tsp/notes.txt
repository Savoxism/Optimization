- The minimum spanning tree provides a good lower bound for the cost of TSP tour because we might never know the optimal solution but we can be certain that the MST < optimal solution -> Compare the ratio of a feasible solution to the MST

Since the MST connects all vertices with the minimal total edge weight (but does not necessarily form a tour), its weight will always be less than or equal to the cost of the optimal TSP solution.


Some TSP problems have two big assumptions:
1) It is symmetric TSP 
2) The triangle inequality holds
